## Problem Description

Chick-fil-A is a fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in chicken sandwiches, nuggets, biscuits, and other chicken-based dishes. Chick-fil-A allows franchisees to own and operate a Chick-fil-A restaurant which is depicted by a restaurant location. Owners can franchise one restaurant or multiple and each restaurant has their own operations and employees. The locations have the same menu which comes down from Chick-fil-A headquarters. As any fast food operation, Chick-fil-A has a menu filled with items that customers can order from. Additionally, Chick-fil-A has ingredients which are used in making the food the restaurant sells. Chick-fil-A has employees who have shifts as well because the employees help run operations through cooking, taking orders, cleaning, doing dishes, etc. Chick-fil-A also has customers who have loyalty accounts so they can obtain rewards, among other things. Overall, Chick-fil-A's business operation prioritizes high-quality food made with fresh ingredients and exceptional customer service. Corporate also emphasizes the importance of franchise partnerships and fostering the mission and vision of the company.
